First thing we have variables 
int a=10, b=25, fq=0, fr=0;
After this, we fork a child, the child will have a copy of the above variables
Now we go to the if statement, in the parent, we will execute the else part of this if statement.
However, within the child process, we will do the if statement.
Now we will run the else part.
the variables values are stille the same
int a=10, b=25

b=a+b-5;

we will get the output of

a=10
b=30
ID=3198

Now we will run the child process. The child had a copy of the original values from start.
int a=10, b=25

we will run this part
a=a+b;

New values are
int a=35, b=25

output is
a=35
b=25
ID=3199
Right after this, we encounter a fork. This will create a new child with the previous new values
int a=35, b=25

Now if we look at the next if statement, we notice that the parent is within the if statement and child is in the else.

Now we will run the parent.
we will run this line.
b=b+20;
the values should be
int a=35, b=45

our output is
a=35
b=45
ID=3199

we notice that the ID is the same. This should happen because we are still within the first child and it is also a parent.

Finally we will run the else part of this statement. 
Let's recall that the values of the child are
int a=35, b=25
we will execute this line
a=(a*b)+30;

our new a is 905 and b is the same 25.

our output is
a=905
b=25
ID=3200

we finally end here.
